In the words of Neil Gershenfeld, once upon a time computers were large bulky machines that took up an entire room and were operated by people with specialized training. This is quite similar to fabrication and manufacturing technology today: for the most part the things we use are created by large specialized machines by people with specialized knowledge. 

Tools for digital fabrication such as 3D printers and CNC machines mark a turning point in the evolution of how we make things.

Low-income housing is also a problem.

The city should partner and provide incentives to a private developer who sets aside a percentage of units for not only low-income housing units but middle-income units as well.

While sidewalk space is at a premium, there are many suitable sites (especially near intersections) where covered parking for 4-8 bikes could be installed without obstructing pedestrian and wheelchair access.   The most useful place to have the racks would be in the middle of dense residential neighborhoods, rather than in commercial squares.

The participatory budget would fund a pilot program for installing several covered bike racks in neighborhoods and then collecting feedback from cyclists who use them.  Based on the use patterns for the covered parking and cyclist satisfaction level, the City could then evaluate installing them on a more widespread basis in every neighborhood.","Budget Delegates discussed bike racks and bike parking at length, and a bike rack/parking idea made it to their semi-final list, but other suggestions were ranked as higher priority.

This small change had an oversized impact to traffic and, subsequently, quality of life in my North Cambridge neighborhood.

Now, if one car waits to take a left, every other car behind them misses the light as well. This routinely causes backups all the way to the Peabody School. This is a largely residential area, so it impacts residents and those trying to drop their children off at school and make their way to work. My idea has two options: The first is to redraw the double yellow lines to accommodate cars continuing straight on Rindge Ave - so they do not have to wait behind those taking a left on Sherman Street.

I would like to point out an easily addressed aspect of the dangerous intersection of Fresh Pond Parkway and Huron Avenue.
This crossing is the site of at least one pedestrian fatality that I know of. 
We need ""a no right turn on red"" here. 

At present Westbound( toward the Charles River) traffic is permitted to turn right on red, despite the fact that the pedestrian crossing sign says ""go.""
The slope and configuration of this intersection for some reason encourages drivers to treat it as a speed way, resulting in dangerous behavior when turning right from the Parkway onto Huron Ave. 
Drivers may or may not actually stop before turning right on red, but few look at the cross walk they are about to speed through. 
There are many close calls every hour. Close calls are precursors to catastrophe, but they do not appear in the city data.",Not eligible - not City property (belongs to state).,Russ Windman,"Fresh Pond Parkway

Our only broadband provider has a monopoly and is sloooow, due to aging copper-wire infrastructure. Although Harvard University has incredible internet, the same can't be said about the neighborhoods around the rest of Cambridge. I moved from a neighborhood to campus solely because the internet was so much more superior. Unreliable, slow internet is not a great representative of a forward-thinking community such as ours. I lived in the South Boston, where AT&T provides awesome fiber optic internet for relatively good rates, the same as I was paying for crappy cable. We should either encourage the current company to step up their game, or invite AT&T to bring their fiber optics here. We should also apply to be the next Google Fiber city, if we haven't already done so. TLDR: fast internet can make all the difference in how a community progresses. Get fiber here now, and stop relying on 1800's technology","Not eligible. Fiber optic internet infrastucture already exists in Cambridge. Fiber optic internet is available through Verizon.

There is a neighbor on the street that has a large strawberry patch on her front lawn. So many kids over the years have enjoyed eating her free strawberries each spring. My child has enjoyed eating the cherries off the miniature cherry tree on the strip. There could be four dozen small plots on the strip. A nice curved s path and low fencing could define the spaces. Each spring people could sign up at the library for a plot and then plant what they want. People can pick fruits and vegetables from the plots.  Perhaps there should be a water fountain on the strip near the library so one can rinse and eat! Dog walkers can continue to use the strip as before, having a beautified communal place to walk their dogs. (People here do a good job of picking up after their dogs.) A couple benches and rocking chairs would be nice touches to send a message to enjoy the space.","Budget Delegates did not rank this as a high priority project.

1. To be implemented in month-long after-school/work and weekend classes specifically for different age groups and at different skill levels.
2. We could move the classes around to various libraries and community centers via portable laptops.
3. The money would be spent to buy computer programs and compensate experts for their time via the Cambridge Public Library.
4. The classes would be free of change but with limited capacity. Ideally no more than 10 at a time.
5. The classes would be filled via a short application process.
6. We could start with specifically music (Ableton) and expand to other Digital Arts programs according to demand.

In doing so we are giving the young creative community tools they can then use as a foundation to become employable in a Digital Arts field. [More description in comments on map]",Not eligible due to operating funds required to hold classes. ,David D.,"567 Massachusetts Avenue

This proposal fits the project guidelines well as a 1-time public works project which benefits all citizens and matches the budget: 1 mile of protected bike lane costs ~$440,000 [5]. Boston already plans to build protected bike lanes on Commonwealth Ave. [6]. Letâ€™s lead similar changes along Mass. Ave.! Protected bike lanes will send a welcomed message to all bikers as they cross the Charles River: Cambridge wants you to safe.

PB2 (June-December 2015),S085,"Streets, Sidewalks & Transit","Create a traffic study of city east of Prospect. Reroute traffic, change signals, rethink lanes.","The developments in Kendall, plus the seemingly random set of one-way streets, plus parking issues, plus an increase in bike use, have made traffic in the area east of Prospect a frustrating and dangerous mess. People use small residential streets as overflow routes because the main roads are so crowded. Traffic signals at major crossings are timed to impeded, rather than facilitate, traffic flow. Bike lanes and car lanes cross one another. Cars idle, spewing exhaust and burning extra fuel. Side streets are dangerous for residents. 

Let's finance a traffic study of this area with an eye to safety, environmental impact, smooth flow, bicycle/car/pedestrian co-existence. Let's look at traffic patterns, signal timing, lane marking, time-of-day variations.  Maybe this is something the engineers at MIT could be part of.","Not eligible through the PB process, not a capital project. ",Tim,"Elm Street

PB2 (June-December 2015),S135,"Streets, Sidewalks & Transit",A Cambridge car parking app,"Every week, there are dozens of cars that are towed simply because the days of street cleaning are hard to keep track of. Similarly, it is hard to remember where your car is parked on the many different streets it may be parked on. It is also often hard to even find an available spot. This causes several problems. Street cleaning is held up by cars that need to be towed, people need to pay a lot of money once they find out their car has been towed, people spend a lot of time looking for their cars and looking for parking spots with frustration. I believe an app that tracks available parking spots, knows the exact days and exact streets of street cleaning and is able to alert car owners when those times approach, and is able to indicate where someone last parked their car would alleviate a lot of frustration.

The other day I saw a guy pull up to drop somebody off, then just wait there. He pulled up to the right-hand side of a parked car, thus completely blocking any cyclist who wanted to use the cycle track. Just a few well-placed plastic posts would prevent this. I know there's probably some long-term plan to put curbs in or something but why not install some cheap plastic posts NOW so the cycle track will actually function properly. Another reason is that people often get ticketed and/or towed for parking in the cycle track, which can sometimes be caused by simple confusion that would be alleviated by plastic posts. Better to just prevent people from parking there at all than to let them park and then tow.

Such wire can eventually girdle a  tree, leaving the tree damaged in ways that can kill it. When wire is used for public signage, the city's concern is ensuring the signage is noticeable and no concern is given to the tree after the wiring has served its purpose. I propose putting aside a part of the budget for quarterly monitoring and removal of wire left in these situations. I believe the city could fund a volunteer force with pliers, wire cutters, waste bags, and heavy gloves. The latter are needed as many wires are heavily rusted and can pose a health risk when handling.

In almost all cases, this results in 2 x 4 pine boards secured to lower tree trunks in anticipation of possible mechanical injury to the tree. These boards are often secured so tightly to the tree that they impede any trunk girth growth. These boards are not secured for short periods of time, but often many months, and possibly years, and are even left on the tree when work needs to cease for a season. Throughout Cambridge, one can notice the tree beginning to grow into these boards, greatly hindering if not completely preventing healthy, natural growth - this is the antithesis of the boards being secured in the first place. I propose that Cambridge budget quarterly inspection of tree protection constructed by work permit holders. Note: proper inspection can only be conducted by a trained arborist, and not one who is only to confirm that boards are secured.

I had the same feelings about it growing up as a Cambridge kid in the '70's. I always thought it looked scary.  Cambridge is setting an example with this alternative approach to education, but the facility nearly negates the efforts.

The larger complex includes Russell Field, serving thousands of residents through recreation and MBTA bus and subway.

Since  Cambridge is working towards increasing bike lane availability and promoting biking,  it should also mandate that bike sharing companies also provide helmets with each bike rental.  The Mobi bike riding system in Vancouver, Canada,  not only provides a helmet with each bike but each station also has a supply of helmet liners, to encourage people who might not want to share helmets, to wear them.  Their helmets have holes drilled into the top and the bike handle has a  retractable lock wire that you thread the helmet through before securing the wire with the bike back in the station.

I can remember seeing 2 rats in the first 55 years of living in this neighborhood and now I can see rats every night of the week if I look out the window for any length of time.  Other cities are taking a more proactive position on controlling the rat population.  Somerville is placing ""rat birth control"" in locations throughout the city and Boston is placing dry ice in rat holes to kill them in their burrows underground.  Rats can become a huge public health problem with the diseases they can carry and should be addressed in amore proactive way by the city. In the last 10 years there have been a few cases of bubonic plague and an outbreak Roto virus reported in other parts of the country.  This is a quality of life issue. I set rat traps in my yard a few times per week and virtually every time I set them the traps are sprung. I catch an average of 3 rats/week and as many as 5 in 1 night. The larger rats will take the bait and set the trap off but are TOO BIG to be caught in the trap. Looking out my back window at night I have seen as many as 7 rats at one time. They rats have chewed holes in my public works sold compost bin and in 1 covered plastic trash barrel. I suspect that the trash collectors cracked the bottom when they THROW the barrels back on the side walk and thus let smells from the trash attract the rat to the barrel even though it is covered.","Did not move forward.

This project would be modeled after the many European cities that have implemented this. Specific design elements include:
- Raised intersections at all entrances to the slow zone
- Narrowing the entrance to the slow streets to one lane of traffic, regardless of whether a one or two lane street
- Implement diverters on longer streets to prevent vehicles from traveling in a straight line the entire street

The green walls are flexible and can either mount to existing buildings or be free-standing.  Jade Chain was inspired by a 13-foot Plant wall, called “City Tree,” capable of consuming as much air pollution in an urban environment as a small forest.

While this will help speed up bus trips and make the #1 bus more reliable, two other ""transit priority"" strategies are probably even more effective in reducing bus travel delays and keeping buses on their schedules. These include installing short segments of fully dedicated, exclusive bus lanes (or ""queue jump"" lanes as they are often called) both immediately before and after the most congested intersections to allow buses to get in and out of bus stops more quickly and fully take advantage of the transit signal priority at that intersection. In addition, in order to speed-up boarding and alighting of passengers at our busiest stops, the City can test various mechanisms for the payment of fares before passengers enter the bus, allowing the driver to open both doors and passengers can freely get on and off the bus much more quickly. This might involve rugged fare boxes on the sidewalk and/or small card readers to tap for those with CharlieCards.

Rather than repair it or remove graffiti, the City has chosen to slowly dismantle it, removing and never returning glass plates. This creates that worst of both worlds, a deteriorating bus shelter and an impression that the City doesn't care about art in Central Square, a designated Cultural District. As other participatory budgeting items note, bus riders deserve real time arrival information, something that immensely improves the ridership experience. Central Square also needs wayfinding so that people looking for one of its myriad bus stops know where to go. This proposal is to fund an appropriate project to *both* renew the art and provide bus riders with necessary information services. ",To be determined,Saul Tannenbaum,"Massachusetts Ave @ Pearl St

We were asked to find a solution that would significantly reduce or re-purpose food waste in Cambridge by 2018. Our team's approach was to tackle the issue through education and technology. When students throw away leftovers, the scraps currently go to an outside composting facility. We proposed installing an anaerobic digester instead. Within the digester, microorganisms break down food scraps and produce biogas, fueling our stoves for the next meal. Our idea was to locate it at CRLS to use it as an educational opportunity for students.

This neighborhood in particular needs updated, safe areas where children of all ages can engage in safe, creative, physical play during all phases of their life. Adding an exercise area similar to the one at Northpoint park for older kids, in the Park with the basketball court (Clement Morgan I believe) may be a positive addition that will provide activity space for this age group.  The play space here would also benefit from some updating including removal of the wood chips and the addition of soft ground that has been added to other parks so younger kids had more space to run and possible ride their scooters and bikes. The tot lot (Anthony C?) across the street is dangerous, rather than inviting, for the little ones.  The structure is made of wood which causes splinters.  There are concrete curbs throughout the area which are not safe for little ones who are still learning to walk.  The one animal for riding is some sort of metal and the device that exists as a merry go round option is just sad.  This whole park could use an overhaul. Soft ground throughout, no curbs or wood chips, all new play structures, water play area rather than an outdated sprinkler model.  Again, Northpoint provides a good model.  Another issue here is that there are no sprinklers for the older kids in Morgan Park so when it is hot they come to the toddler park.

Ave.  Specific locations where benches are needed include between Trolley Square and Porter Square, between Trolley Square and Davis Square on Linnear Park (the Cambridge section), and in front of Pemberton Market and China Fair on north Mass. Ave.  Having more benches at bus stops where people wait a long time is also needed. Any bench that the City has installed at bus stops has been wonderful.  It would be great to have benches every two blocks.
 Benches create community. People of all ages want benches to rest, talk, tinker with smartphones, people watch, and enjoy the city and outdoors.  Having benches in front of stores can also increase business. Benches are very flexible, so if one is installed in a location that doesn't work well, you can always pull up the bolts and reposition it.   

This idea is for regular benches – not soofa benches, which promote a different kind of thing (people on phones). Benches also don’t necessarily need to have dividers in the middle. The City shouldn’t let decisions about benches be controlled by not wanting a homeless person to sleep on them. Homeless folks have a right to sit on them, and most people know not to sleep on benches already. Our tax money should go to improvements that make a more comfortable community, like benches that everyone can enjoy. According to Councillor Carlone, studies have shown that just putting in benches can can generate up to 10% more in sales for businesses: http://cambridge.wickedlocal.com/news/20170627/cambridge-city-council-seeking-faster-roll-out-of-protected-bike-lanes ",To be determined,Marie G,"Massachusetts Avenue, citywide

The biggest advance has been in the system control algorithms which now enable individual travel lines to have higher speed and capacity than traditional bus, car or subway. While it may seem counter-intuitive at first, a closer look would show that it is time to reevaluate PRT as a viable means of transportation. A properly engineered PRT would increase the capacity and speed of our transportation system. It also makes pedestrians and biking safer by reducing car travel. Reduction of car travel has added environmental benefits.  This system would benefit all Cambridge residents and be an example for other cities to follow.

Drivers think they have a green light and should not stop in an awkward place 75 yards away from a stop line. Pedestrians have a WALK light and become angry at drivers. Daily MADNESS.
