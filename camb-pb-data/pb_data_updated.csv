Drivers often ignore or don't see pedestrians in this crosswalk because they are looking ahead to the next set of traffic lights. A system with embedded lights would help signal simultaneously to the 4 lanes of traffic that someone is waiting to cross the road. Crossing the road is currently a game of leapfrog from one lane to the next. One lane of traffic might stop but the other lane, going in the same direction, might not stop. It also feels unsafe to cross 2 lanes and then wait at the small median in order to cross the second set of 2 lanes while traffic on both sides rushes past.",Budget Delegates did not rank this as a high priority project.

At the Cedar St/Mass Ave intersection, they are currently forced to cross Cedar St., then wait on a little triangle (often full of bikes at peak times), and then cross Mass Ave. It would be much better for cyclists and pedestrians to have their own protected traffic light cycle to cross the street (a ""Barnes Dance"" design). Then bikers and walkers could go directly from the path to the path, without waiting through two light cycles. Plus they would be safer, because they would not be at risk from turning vehicles. I propose re-programming the traffic light, painting a diagonal ""crossing route"" for bikes and pedestrians, and putting up additional signage reminding drivers to look out for bikes and pedestrians at this intersection.","Not eligible through the PB process, not a capital project.

The number one priority ahead of connecting major shopping and employment centers was making sure that children could bike safely to their public or private school. In order for our children to use this bikeway network one day, we need to teach them how to navigate it by walking, biking, and driving.

I know there's probably some long-term plan to put curbs in or something but why not install some cheap plastic posts NOW so the cycle track will actually function properly. Another reason is that people often get ticketed and/or towed for parking in the cycle track, which can sometimes be caused by simple confusion that would be alleviated by plastic posts.

Such wire can eventually girdle a  tree, leaving the tree damaged in ways that can kill it. When wire is used for public signage, the city's concern is ensuring the signage is noticeable and no concern is given to the tree after the wiring has served its purpose. I propose putting aside a part of the budget for quarterly monitoring and removal of wire left in these situations. I believe the city could fund a volunteer force with pliers, wire cutters, waste bags, and heavy gloves. The latter are needed as many wires are heavily rusted and can pose a health risk when handling.

In almost all cases, this results in 2 x 4 pine boards secured to lower tree trunks in anticipation of possible mechanical injury to the tree. These boards are often secured so tightly to the tree that they impede any trunk girth growth. These boards are not secured for short periods of time, but often many months, and possibly years, and are even left on the tree when work needs to cease for a season. Throughout Cambridge, one can notice the tree beginning to grow into these boards, greatly hindering if not completely preventing healthy, natural growth - this is the antithesis of the boards being secured in the first place. I propose that Cambridge budget quarterly inspection of tree protection constructed by work permit holders. Note: proper inspection can only be conducted by a trained arborist, and not one who is only to confirm that boards are secured.

Unfortunately, due to the width of certain sections of Mass Ave, and the budget being unable to fund curb, sidewalk, or median reconstruction, the plan will still leave approximately 2 1/2 blocks along the route with no bicycle facilities other than shared lane markings. Shared lane markings will not provide the safety or traffic throughput that are needed in this area, and will continue to force cyclists to veer into motor vehicle lanes on this busy stretch of Mass Ave. With moderate funding, the city could redesign the street and make pavement and curb changes as necessary to build high quality separate and buffered cycle lanes on these 2.5 blocks to complete the connectivity on North Mass Ave.",To be determined,Randy Stern,"Massachusetts Avenue

Add a code, linking each phone number's home address to its Cambridge district for cleaning.  That only has to be done once.  Then send a general reminder one day before each district's cleaning schedule, saying how the odd/even street number requirement applies there.

The measures put in place a few years ago as far as covered trash barrels and no trash at the curb before 7:00pm are just not working. I can remember seeing 2 rats in the first 55 years of living in this neighborhood and now I can see rats every night of the week if I look out the window for any length of time.  Other cities are taking a more proactive position on controlling the rat population.  Somerville is placing ""rat birth control"" in locations throughout the city and Boston is placing dry ice in rat holes to kill them in their burrows underground.  Rats can become a huge public health problem with the diseases they can carry and should be addressed in amore proactive way by the city. In the last 10 years there have been a few cases of bubonic plague and an outbreak Roto virus reported in other parts of the country.  This is a quality of life issue. I set rat traps in my yard a few times per week and virtually every time I set them the traps are sprung. I catch an average of 3 rats/week and as many as 5 in 1 night. The larger rats will take the bait and set the trap off but are TOO BIG to be caught in the trap. Looking out my back window at night I have seen as many as 7 rats at one time. They rats have chewed holes in my public works sold compost bin and in 1 covered plastic trash barrel. I suspect that the trash collectors cracked the bottom when they THROW the barrels back on the side walk and thus let smells from the trash attract the rat to the barrel even though it is covered.","Did not move forward.

Adding an exercise area similar to the one at Northpoint park for older kids, in the Park with the basketball court (Clement Morgan I believe) may be a positive addition that will provide activity space for this age group.  The play space here would also benefit from some updating including removal of the wood chips and the addition of soft ground that has been added to other parks so younger kids had more space to run and possible ride their scooters and bikes. The tot lot (Anthony C?) across the street is dangerous, rather than inviting, for the little ones.  The structure is made of wood which causes splinters.  There are concrete curbs throughout the area which are not safe for little ones who are still learning to walk.  The one animal for riding is some sort of metal and the device that exists as a merry go round option is just sad.  This whole park could use an overhaul. Soft ground throughout, no curbs or wood chips, all new play structures, water play area rather than an outdated sprinkler model.  Again, Northpoint provides a good model.  Another issue here is that there are no sprinklers for the older kids in Morgan Park so when it is hot they come to the toddler park.

Ave.  Specific locations where benches are needed include between Trolley Square and Porter Square, between Trolley Square and Davis Square on Linnear Park (the Cambridge section), and in front of Pemberton Market and China Fair on north Mass. Ave.  Having more benches at bus stops where people wait a long time is also needed. Any bench that the City has installed at bus stops has been wonderful.  It would be great to have benches every two blocks.
 Benches create community. People of all ages want benches to rest, talk, tinker with smartphones, people watch, and enjoy the city and outdoors.  Having benches in front of stores can also increase business. Benches are very flexible, so if one is installed in a location that doesn't work well, you can always pull up the bolts and reposition it.   

This idea is for regular benches – not soofa benches, which promote a different kind of thing (people on phones). Benches also don’t necessarily need to have dividers in the middle. The City shouldn’t let decisions about benches be controlled by not wanting a homeless person to sleep on them. Homeless folks have a right to sit on them, and most people know not to sleep on benches already. Our tax money should go to improvements that make a more comfortable community, like benches that everyone can enjoy.

AUBURN,"In ancient times, a forum was a place in a Roman city for public assembly (literally, ""a public place outdoors."") Originally for commerce, forums evolved to become sites for meetings, performances, debate, and discussion. In that spirit, we propose to create a new forum where the Watertown-Cambridge Greenway meets Mt. Auburn Street, building a series of steps, tiers, and platforms into the unused and neglected hillside at this location. Besides enhancing safety and access to the Greenway by directly linking the path below to the street above, this project will also create a trailside place for meeting a friend, reading a book, debating current events, drinking a cup of coffee, watching a live performance, buying an ice cream cone, or simply resting by the side of the path on a beautiful sunny day.

The design possibilities--ranging from simple to decorative--can work to protect cyclists while using minimal street space. Traditional bike lanes are good at making cyclists feel safe and improve visibility, however they do not protect cyclists from dooring or from moving vehicles hazards.
